//---- BEGINNER MOVEMENT TUTORIAL
3000 = "Welcome to the beginner movement tutorial! I'm Orby, your host and guide to learning the basics of Rivals of Aether."
3001 = "Let's begin with the basic controls for walking."
3002 = "To walk, gently move the control stick. Don't push too hard, or you'll run instead."
3003 = "Good. Now let's try running."
3004 = "To run, quickly flick the control stick in the direction you want to go."
3005 = "Let's tackle jumping next."
3006 = "To jump, just press the jump button. Make sure to hold the button long enough for a full jump."
3007 = "Now, follow me by using double jumps."
3008 = "To perform a double jump, press the jump button while in the air."
3009 = "Careful though, you can only double jump once until you touch the ground again."
3010 = "These platforms are different from your usual ground. Not only can you jump through them, you can also drop down from them."
3011 = "Quickly press down on the control stick to fall through the platforms.\nWhile falling, you can keep holding down to pass through subsequent platforms."
3012 = "Fantastic! Now that you've mastered the basics of movement, we can move on to the more advanced lessons."

//---- BEGINNER DEFENSE TUTORIAL
3013 = "Welcome to the beginner defense tutorial! The following lessons will teach you basic techniques to defend yourself from enemy attacks."
3014 = "First up is the parry. Parrying is performed by pressing the dodge button on the ground without holding left or right."
3015 = "If you parry an enemy attack, the opponent will be momentarily stunned, leaving them open to a counterattack."
3016 = "Parries are not instant, however.\nThey become active 2 frames after pressing the dodge button.\n(Note: there are 60 frames in a second)"
3017 = "Let's try it out.\nParry my attacks 3 times in a row."
3018 = "Parries can also be used to reflect projectiles."
3019 = "Try reflecting 3 of my projectiles in a row."
3020 = "Now let's try rolling."
3021 = "If you are holding left or right when you press the dodge button, you will roll instead of parrying."
3022 = "Rolling won't stun your opponent, but it can sometimes be less risky than a parry since it can create distance between you and your enemy."
3023 = "Try rolling out of the way of my attack 3 times in a row."
3024 = "Let's move on to air dodging."
3025 = "If you press the dodge button while in the air, you will perform an air dodge.\nHold a direction while air dodging to move in that direction."
3026 = "Careful though, you can only air dodge once until you touch the ground."
3027 = "Jump near me and I'll attack you. Try air dodging my attacks 3 times in a row."
3028 = "Amazing! As you can tell, dodging attacks takes good timing and can be pretty risky."
3029 = "Make sure to practice all of these techniques so that you can defend yourself properly."

//---- BEGINNER OFFENSE TUTORIAL
3030 = "Welcome to the beginner offense tutorial! These lessons will teach you all of the different types of attacks in the game, as well as the terminology used for them."
3031 = "The most basic attack is the jab combo."
3032 = "Press the attack button while your control stick is in a neutral position to start a jab combo."
3033 = "Press the attack button again to continue the jab combo.\nMost jab combos consist of 3 different hits."
3034 = "Let's try it out. Hit me with all 3 hits of your jab combo 3 times in a row."
3035 = "Now let's try a dash attack."
3036 = "While running, simply press the attack button to perform a dash attack."
3037 = "Let's move on."
3038 = "If you hold a direction and press the attack button while on the ground, you will do a light directional attack. These attacks are called 'tilts'."
3039 = "There are 3 different types of tilts, determined by the direction you tilt your control stick."
3040 = "Forward tilt (FTILT): hold sideways and press attack.\nUp tilt (UTILT): hold upward and press attack.\nDown tilt (DTILT): hold downward and press attack."
3041 = "Try hitting me with 3 of each.\n(When doing an Ftilt, make sure not to run first.)"
3042 = "Now let's try strong attacks."
3043 = "If you press the strong button while on the ground, you will perform a strong attack. The type of strong attack you perform depends on the direction you hold."
3044 = "-Forward strong (FSTRONG): hold sideways or neutral and press strong.\n-Up strong (USTRONG): hold upward and press strong.\n-Down strong (DSTRONG): hold downward and press strong."
3045 = "If you hold down the strong button, you can charge your strong attack to increase its power. (With default controls, you can also hold the right stick to perform charged strong attacks.)"
3046 = "Try hitting me with 3 of each type of strong attack."
3047 = "Now let's practice aerial attacks."
3048 = "If you press the attack button or the strong button in the air, you will do an aerial attack."
3049 = "There are five different kinds of aerials, determined by the direction of the control stick."
3050 = "-Neutral air (NAIR): do an aerial with no directional input.\n-Forward air (FAIR): hold forward and do an aerial.\n-Back air (BAIR): hold backward and do an aerial."
3051 = "-Up air (UAIR): hold upward and do an aerial.\n-Down air (DAIR): hold downward and do an aerial."
3052 = "With default controls, you can also perform aerials with the right stick."
3053 = "Try hitting me with 3 of each type of aerial."
3054 = "The final type of attack is a special attack."
3055 = "To use a special attack, press the special button. Special attacks vary greatly between characters, and some specials also change if they're used in the air."
3056 = "There are four types of special attacks, determined by the direction of the control stick."
3057 = "-Neutral special (NSPECIAL): press special with no directional input.\n-Forward special (FSPECIAL): hold forward and press special."
3058 = "-Up special (USPECIAL): hold upward and press special.\n-Down special (DSPECIAL): hold downward and press special."
3059 = "Try hitting me with 3 of each type of special."
3060 = "Perfect! Now that you know all of the different kinds of attacks, you can experiment with them to learn more about each character."
3061 = "Be sure to remember the terminologies for each attack as well as their inputs. Feel free to come back to this lesson anytime if you need to review."

//---- INTERMEDIATE MOVEMENT TUTORIAL
3062 = "Welcome to the intermediate movement tutorial! In this tutorial, you'll learn some of the more technical ways to move around."
3063 = "First up is the short hop."
3064 = "A short hop is exactly what it sounds like: a smaller version of your normal jump."
3065 = "To do a short hop, just tap the jump button briefly."
3066 = "If you hold the jump button for more than 5 frames, you will do a full hop instead of a short hop, so you must be quick. (Note: these 5 frames are called jumpsquat.)"
3067 = "Try short hopping over my projectiles 3 times in a row."
3068 = "Short hops are great for minimizing the time you're in the air so you can reach the ground faster, which allows you to extend your combos even further."
3069 = "Another way to land quickly is to fastfall, which gives you an instant downward boost."
3070 = "To perform a fastfall, quickly press the control stick downward while you are falling."
3071 = "You cannot fastfall if you are moving upward, so make sure you time the fastfall after the peak of your jump."
3072 = "Try jumping in front of me and then using fastfall to avoid my attack 3 times in a row."
3073 = "Sometimes a successful recovery requires more than your regular jumps, and that's where wall jumping comes in."
3074 = "Performing a walljump is simple: Once you're in the air, hold the control stick toward the wall and press the jump button."
3075 = "You can only walljump once until you touch the ground or get hit."
3076 = "Try reaching that platform with a walljump. Sorry, but I've temporarily disabled your double jump."
3077 = "You can also walljump while in the helpless fall state."
3078 = "Try reaching the platform, this time using only USPECIALs and walljumps.\n(Note: Zetterburn's USPECIAL travels in the direction of the control stick.)"
3079 = "Fantastic!"
3080 = "These wall jump techniques will help your recovery immensely when you're sent offstage. Make sure you practice all of these techniques so you can use them anytime you need them."

//---- INTERMEDIATE DEFENSE TUTORIAL
3081 = "Welcome to the intermediate defense tutorial! Here you will learn about directional influence and teching. Correct use of these techniques is vital to your survival, so pay attention."
3082 = "Let's start with Directional Influence, which is often shortened to DI."
3083 = "DI is the ability to change the angle at which you travel when launched by the enemy. To DI an attack, simply hold a direction on your control stick when you're hit."
3084 = "If I were to hit you with an attack that naturally sends in this direction..."
3085 = "And you were to hold your control stick in this direction..."
3086 = "You would be sent flying in this new direction."
3087 = "By holding the control stick perpendicular to the original knockback angle, you can change the trajectory angle by up to 18 degrees!"
3088 = "Remember, DI can only change the angle at which you are hit, not how hard you are hit."
3089 = "Let's try it out. Move your control stick around to test the effects of DI."
3090 = "Notice how holding the control stick parallel to the knockback angle has the same effect as no DI at all."
3091 = "There are two ways to apply DI:\n  1. Surviving strong attacks (Survival DI)\n  2. Escaping combos (Combo DI)"
3092 = "Lesson 1 will be on Survival DI."
3093 = "This dotted line represents the blastzone.\nIf you pass the blastzone, you lose one stock."
3094 = "If you're hit by a strong attack that sends you flying in this direction, you will certainly pass the blastzone if you don't DI."
3095 = "If you DI this hit downward, you will die even earlier."
3096 = "If you DI upward, however, you will survive the attack! Notice how the arrow never crosses the dotted line."
3097 = "Let's try it out! Use good DI to survive my attack 3 times in a row."
3098 = "Very nice! Once you implement this into your play style, your stocks will last a lot longer."
3099 = "Now..."
3100 = "Let's learn how to use DI to escape from combos."
3101 = "Many combo moves send you at an angle similar to this one."
3102 = "If you hold inward, the opponent will be able to easily follow up with another attack."
3103 = "If you hold outward, however, the opponent will have to move a lot farther to hit you again."
3104 = "Try using DI to escape my combo 3 times in a row. Just try to touch the ground before going offstage."
3105 = "Those are the basics of DI. With some attacks, applying DI isn't as simple as what you just learned. But with practice, DI will help you out in most bad situations."
3106 = "Let's move on to teching."
3107 = "You see, touching the ground while in hitstun will put you in a helpless state for a short time. If you are hit downward hard enough, it can even bounce you off the ground."
3108 = "To avoid these bad situations, you must tech!"
3109 = "If you press the dodge button right before touching the ground, you will perform a tech."
3110 = "Teching makes you briefly invincible, but your opponent can punish you if they predict the tech."
3111 = "If you hold left or right when teching, you will perform a tech roll."
3112 = "Tech rolls are slower than a tech in place, but it can create distance between you and your opponent."
3113 = "When trying to tech, you cannot just mash the dodge button. You must time the button press within 20 frames of hitting the ground."
3114 = "Immediately after those 20 frames, there is a 20 frame period where you cannot input another tech attempt."
3115 = "Okay, time to try it out. Tech my attacks 3 times in a row.\nJump near me when you're ready."
3116 = "You can also tech on walls the same way you tech on the ground."
3117 = "Let's try combining DI and teching for the final lesson."
3118 = "DI my attack so that you hit the wall, then tech it so you don't bounce off."
3119 = "Excellent!"
3120 = "Now that you understand DI and teching, your opponent will have to try much harder to defeat you."
3121 = "These techniques take practice though, so keep training until you've mastered them."

//---- INTERMEDIATE OFFENSE TUTORIAL
3122 = "Welcome to the intermediate offense tutorial! Here you will learn how to apply your attacks in different ways."
3123 = "First, let's learn more about how attacks work in general."
3124 = "Each attack consists of one or more hitboxes. An opponent gets hit by an attack if they touch one of its hitboxes."
3125 = "Hitboxes are normally invisible, but if you go into training mode, you can view the hitboxes for any attack."
3126 = "Some moves have tiny hitboxes called 'sweet spots'. Sweet spots are usually very small and very powerful."
3127 = "Sweet spots are usually found inside larger, weaker hitboxes (sour spots). If both hitboxes hit the enemy, the sweet spot usually takes priority over the sour spot."
3128 = "Here are some examples of sweet spots and sour spots. Notice how much larger the sour spot is."
3129 = "Zetterburn has sweet spots on his FAIR and UAIR, which are excellent kill moves."
3130 = "Try hitting me 3 times with the sweet spot of either FAIR or UAIR."
3131 = "Now let's learn how to combo moves together."
3132 = "Comboing is the concept of stringing moves together without giving your opponent time to escape."
3133 = "Because of directional influence, most combos are not guaranteed. In order to continue comboing your opponent, you must react to which direction they go."
3134 = "Let's test it out. Start a combo on me with the first hit of UTILT, then I'll mix up my DI to either stay close to you or go far away."
3135 = "When I stay close, hit me with an aerial. When I go far, hit me with a dash attack."
3136 = "Combo me 3 times in a row. I'll alternate between DIing in and out every time you start a combo."
3137 = "Many times, you will have to predict your opponent's DI to be able to continue a combo. Certain situations call for certain types of combos, and understanding this comes with practice and experience."
3138 = "Now let's try edgeguarding."
3139 = "Edgeguarding is a powerful technique that prevents your opponents from recovering after being knocked off the stage."
3140 = "There are two main methods for edgeguarding:\n -Staying on stage: safer but easier for the opponent to avoid.\n -Going offstage: riskier but harder for the opponent to avoid."
3141 = "Powerful attacks that send downward or horizontally are generally very good edgeguard moves, since most opponents have fewer options when recovering low."
3142 = "Keep in mind that your opponent may use wall jumping for recovery as well, so sending the opponent far away from a wall also limits their options considerably."
3143 = "Let's try it out. Successfully edgeguard this Zetterburn 3 times. Make sure his feet never touch the ground."
3144 = "Good! The next lesson will cover how to effectively deal with parries."
3145 = "As you know, if an opponent parries your attack, you will be stunned. The exception to this rule is the jab combo, excluding the final hit."
3146 = "If an opponent parries one of the first two hits of your jab combo, they will still gain invincibility but you will not be stunned. This makes jab a safe way to apply pressure to opponents who parry often."
3147 = "Test it out by jabbing me, then running away from my counterattack after I parry you. Make sure not to do the 3rd hit of jab."
3148 = "Let's bring tilts into the equation."
3149 = "After jabbing, you can attack with a tilt instead of continuing the jab combo."
3150 = "This allows you to hit confirm your jabs into different tilts so you can mix up your combo starters."
3151 = "Try hitting me with a jab and cancelling it into a tilt 3 times."
3152 = "Excellent!"
3153 = "Most of the concepts in this tutorial take a lot of practice to perfect, but it is necessary to master them in order to defeat tougher opponents. Keep training!"

//---- ADVANCED MOVEMENT TUTORIAL
3154 = "Welcome to the advanced movement tutorial! While the execution of these moves is fairly easy, applying them to your gameplay takes practice and strategy."
3155 = "Let's start with dash dancing."
3156 = "When you first input a dash, you enter a state called 'initial dash'.\nThis state lasts for a short time, then transitions into the 'run' state."
3157 = "If you try to turn around during the 'run' state, you'll have to go through a turnaround animation which slows your movement down."
3158 = "However, if you try to turn around during the 'initial dash' state, you will instantly dash in the other direction. This is called a dash dance."
3159 = "Dash dancing is very useful when trying to weave in and out of an opponent's attack range. It also helps to keep your movement unpredictable."
3160 = "Try to dash underneath me, then dash dance away before I can hit you. (Start your dash relatively close to me, so you don't enter the 'run' state. If you enter the turnaround animation under me, your score will be reset.)"
3161 = "Repeated use of dash dancing is extremely effective at confusing enemies as long as you keep the timing unpredictable."
3162 = "Another technique that can keep your movement unpredictable is the wavedash."
3163 = "Wavedashing is performed by air dodging into the ground immediately after jumping. When landing during an air dodge, you keep the momentum from the air dodge."
3164 = "If you angle your airdodge horizontally, you will quickly move sideways.\nIf you angle your airdodge straight downward, you will do a wavedash in place."
3165 = "If you input the air dodge while in jumpsquat, you can wavedash without leaving the ground. This is called buffering a wavedash."
3166 = "Buffering a wavedash while holding the control stick completely horizontal will give you the maximum distance on your wavedash."
3167 = "Let's try it out. Keep wavedashing until you're over here.\n(Note: I've disabled all movement options except the buffered wavedash, so you'll need to do the inputs pretty quickly.)"
3168 = "Like dash dancing, wavedashing is also useful for baiting out enemy attacks."
3169 = "Next up is wavelanding."
3170 = "Wavelanding is when you air dodge into the ground while in the air.\nIt is frequently used to quickly land on platforms."
3171 = "Wavelanding horizontally is also a great way to cover a long distance very quickly."
3172 = "To try out wavelanding, jump through the platform and air dodge onto it once you're above it. Repeat this 3 times."
3173 = "Excellent!"
3174 = "Be sure to practice these movement techniques frequently, as they are vital to having an intimidating offense and a tricky defense."
3175 = "Even though you know how to execute these moves, you will still need to discover when to use them to get the most out of them. This comes with experience."

//---- ADVANCED DEFENSE TUTORIAL
3176 = "Welcome to the advanced defense tutorial! The techniques presented in this lesson are fairly situational but incredibly useful."
3177 = "First, we'll learn how to survive when you're spiked downward offstage."
3178 = "All you need is a combination of good DI and a wall tech."
3179 = "DI my attack toward the wall, then tech as soon as you hit the wall."
3180 = "Nice!"
3181 = "Now let's learn how to survive strong attacks at the ledge."
3182 = "Right when you're hit with an attack, you will stop in place for a few frames.\nThis is called hitpause."
3183 = "While you are in hitpause near a wall, you can input a wall tech regardless of the direction the attack sends you."
3184 = "Try using a diagonal uspecial to ride up this wall. When you get close to me while using uspecial, I will attack you."
3185 = "Tech my attack 3 times in a row. Make sure you are touching the wall when you get hit, or else you won't be able to tech against it."
3186 = "While this technique is useful for all characters, it is absolutely vital to Zetterburn's recovery."
3187 = "The next lesson is all about SDI, which stands for Shift Directional Influence. It is used to escape from multi-hit moves."
3188 = "Pressing the left or right stick in a direction right when you are hit by a move will move your character a short distance."
3189 = "You can only shift once per hit, so the effect is minimal on single-hit moves."
3190 = "Try to escape my attack before the final hit by pressing the control stick away from me every time you get hit."
3191 = "Great!"
3192 = "Now for the final lesson in defense: Drift DI."
3193 = "After being hit by a move, you can drift left or right while flying through the air. This is separate from DI, as it occurs after you are launched."
3194 = "For instance, you can drift inward after a strong hit to avoid flying too far. You can also drift outward while being comboed to put more space between you and your opponent."
3195 = "A combination of inward DI followed by outward Drift DI can help you escape from seemingly guaranteed combos."
3196 = "DI my hit inward, then drift away to avoid my next attack."
3197 = "Incredible!"
3198 = "Proper use of these techniques will serve you well when trying to foil the opponent's plans, so be sure to practice them until they're second nature."

//---- ADVANCED OFFENSE TUTORIAL
3199 = "Welcome to the advanced offense tutorial! Here, you will learn how to use timing and quick inputs to give you more options for attacking your opponents."
3200 = "First, let's learn to autocancel multi-hit aerials."
3201 = "While doing a multi-hit aerial, try landing before the final hit comes out. This way, the enemy will not be sent very far and you'll be able to combo them easily afterward."
3202 = "It is much easier to autocancel an aerial if you fastfall, since there will be less time for the final hit to come out."
3203 = "Try hitting me with a autocancelled NAIR followed by an UTILT 3 times.\nBe sure to start your NAIR right before you land so that the final hit never comes out. Fastfalling will also help cancel the final hit."
3204 = "Some characters benefit from autocancelled aerials more than others, so try it out with all of them."
3205 = "The next technique will allow you to jump toward an enemy while facing backward. This allows you to use BAIRs to approach your enemies."
3206 = "This is called a Reverse Aerial Rush, or RAR for short."
3207 = "To perform a RAR, all you have to do is jump while in the 'run turnaround' state."
3208 = "In the 'run turnaround' state, you will lose forward momentum gradually. So the earlier you input the jump, the faster your RAR will travel."
3209 = "Remember, you cannot enter the 'run turnaround' state from the 'initial dash' state, so make sure you've run far enough to enter the 'run' state before pressing backward."
3210 = "As soon as you leave the ground, you'll want to start holding foward again so you can maintain foward momentum."
3211 = "So the inputs are:\nRun -> Press backward + Jump -> Hold forward -> Aerial\nThe middle 3 inputs should be done as fast as possible."
3212 = "Try hitting me with 3 RAR BAIRs while I'm offstage.\nYou can check the text at the bottom to see if you're doing the RAR correctly."
3213 = "Good!"
3214 = "The next technique is called the Special Reverse."
3215 = "When inputting a special attack, you can reverse its direction by pressing the opposite direction immediately afterward."
3216 = "To test this out, try reversing a DSPECIAL to hit me."
3217 = "Nice!"
3218 = "For the next lesson, you'll learn how to beat parries.\nAll it takes is a bit of patience."
3219 = "If your opponent is parrying a lot of your approaches, it means you're starting to become predictable."
3220 = "If this happens, you can trick your opponent into thinking that you're going to attack them by delaying your attacks a little bit."
3221 = "This will cause them to miss their parry and you will get to punish them."
3222 = "You can also achieve this by purposefully missing them with your attacks."
3223 = "Let's test it out! As soon as you come near me, I'll try to parry.\nDelay your attack and punish me for missing the parry."
3224 = "Fantastic!"
3225 = "If your opponent starts catching on to your delayed attacks, you can start mixing it up by alternating between early and later attacks."

3508 = "Excellent!"
3509 = "One of Ori's strongest attacks is DSPECIAL: Bash."
3510 = "If you hit an opponent with Bash, you can launch them at any angle you want. The enemy will fly in the opposite direction of your control stick."
3511 = "Missing a Bash will put Ori in special fall and will likely result in a stock loss if Ori is offstage."
3512 = "Try launching me downward with Bash 3 times."
3513 = "Good!"
3514 = "Ori can also use Bash to throw projectiles back at opponents."
3515 = "When using Bash on a projectile, the timing is much more lenient and has almost no startup time. You can also release the projectile at any time."
3516 = "Try redirecting my projectiles 3 times in a row."
3517 = "Fantastic!"
3518 = "You can even use Bash to alter the trajectory of your own FSPECIAL."
3519 = "You can use this to quickly launch yourself in any direction, letting you engage the opponent or mix up your recovery."
3520 = "Hit me 3 times with a Bashed FSPECIAL."
3521 = "Incredible!"
3522 = "Ori's USPECIAL pulls out Kuro's Feather, allowing Ori to glide back to the stage from far away."
3523 = "Pressing Down on the control stick will cause Ori to put the feather away. You can bring the feather back out by pressing Up on the control stick."
3524 = "If you hit an opponent with USPECIAL, you can cancel the attack with an air dodge. This allows you to extend your combos with wavelands or get even more distance when recovering."
3525 = "Try hitting me with USPECIAL into air dodge into a second USPECIAL 3 times."
3526 = "Perfect!"

3530 = "By crouching before a full jump, Ranno can perform a super jump. This allows him to gain extra height very quickly."
3531 = "Try performing 3 super jumps. Make sure you hold the jump input until you leave the ground."
3532 = "Good!"
3533 = "Ranno's NSPECIAL throws darts which apply poison to opponents. Each time a poisoned opponent performs an attack, they will take damage."
3534 = "Poison can stack up to 4 times. A single poison stack is removed when the opponent lands an attack."
3535 = "The number of darts thrown depends on how long you charge the move. Pressing the dodge button while charging will store the charge."
3536 = "Try storing a full charge of NSPECIAL 3 times."
3537 = "Perfect!"
3538 = "Ranno's DSPECIAL spawns a bubble above him. Knocking enemies into the bubble will trap them inside it. The more poisoned they are, the longer they will be trapped."
3539 = "While you can easily combo a trapped opponent, they can still slightly move around to avoid your attacks."
3540 = "Hitting the bubble allows you to position it, and pressing DSPECIAL again will summon the bubble toward you."
3541 = "Be careful though, as enemies can also knock you into your own bubble and trap you as well."
3542 = "Try knocking me into your bubble 3 times."
3543 = "Great!"
3544 = "Ranno's FSPECIAL is a long-range tongue attack which traps opponents in a bubble. Again, you can trap enemies for a longer duration by poisoning them first."
3545 = "Try applying 4 stacks of poison then hitting me with FSPECIAL 3 times. Remember that you can poison using jabs, strong attacks, or specials."
3546 = "Fantastic!"
3547 = "FSPECIAL can also be used on walls or the ground to launch yourself toward them, aiding in both movement and recovery."
3548 = "The farther the tongue travels before hitting an object, the stronger your boost will be."
3549 = "Try grabbing the ground with FSPECIAL 3 times."
3550 = "Nice!"
3551 = "Ranno's USPECIAL has 3 different variations depending on which inputs you use during the initial rise. Let's try the first two."
3552 = "1. If you don't press anything while rising, you will just rise with a poisonous attack and then go into special fall immediately afterward."
3553 = "2. If you press DSPECIAL while rising, you will cancel the attack into a poisonous dive kick."
3554 = "Hit me 3 times with the USPECIAL dive kick."
3555 = "Wonderful! Now for the third variation..."
3556 = "3. The last variation of Ranno's USPECIAL is activated by holding the attack button while rising."

3558 = "Try hitting me 3 times with USPECIAL spin attack."
3559 = "Excellent!"
3560 = "One technique for swift airborne movement is to cancel the FSPECIAL tongue pull with a jump."
3561 = "If you grab the ground with FSPECIAL but jump right before touching the ground, you will maintain your momentum from the tongue sling."
3562 = "Try hitting me 3 times with a NAIR after sling jumping."

3568 = "Try hitting me with the tip of Clairen's sword with 3 different kinds of attacks. Precision is key."
3569 = "Excellent!"
3570 = "Clairen lacks a projectile of her own, but with the use of DSPECIAL, she can nullify the opponent's projectiles."
3571 = "Use DSPECIAL right before an attack lands to produce a large plasma field and counter the attack. Projectiles that enter the plasma field are instantly destroyed."
3572 = "Try destroying 3 of my projectiles with the plasma field."
3573 = "Great!"
3574 = "When using USPECIAL, you can perform a final hit which unleashes an enormous slash attack and gives Clairen a little bit of extra height."
3575 = "To activate it, perform USPECIAL and keep holding the special button or press it again while rising."
3576 = "Try hitting me 3 times with the final hit of USPECIAL."
3577 = "Fantastic!"
3578 = "Clairen's NSPECIAL is a quick grab attack that holds opponents in place, giving you the choice to throw them forward or backward."

3580 = "Try throwing me both ways 3 times each."
3581 = "Nice!"

//---- SYLVANOS TUTORIAL
3586 = "Welcome to the Sylvanos tutorial!"
3587 = "Sylvanos controls the ground by growing grass that powers up his special attacks and makes his aerial attacks have less landing lag."
3588 = "He automatically grows grass any time he touches the ground.\nLeaving a grass-covered platform for more than a second will cause all grass on that platform to die."
3589 = "Try covering the ground in grass by walking on it."
3590 = "Good!"
3591 = "Another way to cover the ground in grass is to plant a seed with NSPECIAL. The resulting flower will stay on the ground until it takes damage from an enemy attack. Up to 3 flowers can be active at once."
3592 = "The flower creates grass in a small area around it, but can maintain grass for the entire platform. If the grass is destroyed, the flower will instantly regrow it."
3593 = "You can also change the trajectory of the NSPECIAL projectile by holding any direction."
3594 = "Try planting 3 NSPECIAL flowers."
3595 = "Nice!"
3596 = "NSPECIAL can also be used to combo opponents. If it hits an enemy, it will trap them in a flurry of vine attacks."
3597 = "Another way to plant a flower is to press the SPECIAL button after performing the first 2 attacks of the jab combo."
3598 = "Creating a seed with his jab combo sends the projectile at a lower angle than NSPECIAL, so it can be used to avoid planting the seed on platforms."
3599 = "Try using the special jab combo seed 3 times."
3600 = "Excellent!"
3601 = "Sylvanos' FTILT sends a wave of petals along the ground as long as there's grass."
3602 = "Try hitting me with the FTILT petals 3 times."
3603 = "Great!"

3605 = "Try hitting me with DSPECIAL 3 times."
3606 = "Wonderful!"
3607 = "FSPECIAL causes Sylvanos to dash forward and bite enemies, ripping up all grass in the way. The attack will continue to dash forward as long as there is grass under him."
3608 = "Holding forward or backward will cause Sylvanos to dash faster or slower."
3609 = "While on grass, you can cancel FSPECIAL with a jump, but you cannot airdodge immediately after this jump, so you will be unable to safely retreat."
3610 = "Try hitting me with FSPECIAL and then follow up with an aerial 3 times."
3611 = "Fantastic!"
3612 = "USPECIAL causes Sylvanos to dig into the ground and emerge anywhere within a large radius. Move sideways while underground to determine where Sylvanos emerges."
3613 = "If there is grass where Sylvanos emerges, he can perform a strong bite attack by holding SPECIAL."
3614 = "If you don't hold SPECIAL or if there is no grass where he emerges, he will emerge quicker but with no attack."

3621 = "Sylvanos' BAIR fires a strong vine attack that can be angled up or down."

//---- ELLIANA TUTORIAL

3627 = "Elliana uses her steam powered mech to fly around the battlefield and unleash an arsenal of various weapons."
3628 = "Elliana doesn't have a double jump and instead can hover around, even while attacking. Hovering builds up heat, however, and will overheat the mech if used too much."
3629 = "She cannot hover during the endlag of aerials or strong attacks, so she will lose some height when using them."
3630 = "Try hitting me with aerials 3 times. You'll have to hover to reach me."
3631 = "Great!"
3632 = "Another way to build up heat is to hold the ATTACK button when performing DASH ATTACK or FTILT."
3633 = "You can repeat these attacks infinitely until you overheat. Once you're overheated, you'll have to cool off before you can repeat them again."
3634 = "Try doing 3 fully extended DASH ATTACKS followed by 3 fully extended FTILTS."
3635 = "Good!"
3636 = "Using special attacks will also build up heat, so you can't use them too frequently."
3637 = "If you need to cool down, use a strong attack to expel steam from your mech. Steam will hit opponents who come near it, but can be pushed around by attacks."
3638 = "You can use strong attacks both in the air and on the ground, and all of them give you a momentum boost in the opposite direction they attack."
3639 = "Try hitting me 3 times with strong attack steam. Be careful not to overheat or your strong attacks will change."
3640 = "Excellent!"
3641 = "If Elliana is overheated when performing a strong attack, it will create an explosion instead of steam."
3642 = "While overheated, you won't be able to hover or use special moves, so be careful. Strong attacks release heat and can quickly return her to her normal state."
3643 = "Try overheating and hitting me with strong attack explosions 3 times."
3644 = "Nice!"
3645 = "Elliana's NSPECIAL allows her to fire a rocket fist in any direction. After traveling a short distance, the fist will explode."
3646 = "When she fires the rocket fist, the recoil will launch her in the opposite direction."
3647 = "Try hitting me with NSPECIAL's explosion 3 times. I will disable your jump so you have to aim upward."
3648 = "Great!"
3649 = "FSPECIAL fires a missile that can be controlled after firing. Use the control stick to aim the missile, but be careful not to lose track of your own movements."
3650 = "Try hitting me with FSPECIAL 3 times. Your jump is still disabled, so you'll have to aim from the ground."
3651 = "Fantastic!"
3652 = "You can also charge FSPECIAL to fire a large rocket instead. Charged Fspecial can still be controlled, but much less so."
3653 = "Try hitting me with charged FSPECIAL 3 times."
3654 = "Awesome!"
3655 = "Elliana's DSPECIAL drops a sticky bomb straight downward. When it lands on the ground, it stays there and can be detonated with FSPECIAL's missile."
3656 = "Upon detonation, DSPECIAL will explode 3 times, trapping enemies for a short duration."
3657 = "Try hitting DSPECIAL with FSPECIAL 3 times."
3658 = "Awesome!"
3659 = "DSPECIAL can also stick to opponents if dropped on top of them. The bomb will detonate if the player is hit by FSPECIAL."
3660 = "Using DSPECIAL again will remove the bomb from the opponent and drop a new one."
3661 = "Try hitting me with FSPECIAL after sticking me with DSPECIAL 3 times."
3662 = "Perfect!"
3663 = "The quickest way to cool down after overheating is to use USPECIAL. This causes Elliana to abandon ship, leaving her mech behind to explode."
3664 = "This will instantly release all heat, but will put Elliana in a dangerous position, as she is very light and can only air dodge and wall jump when outside of her mech."
3665 = "You can adjust the height of USPECIAL by holding up or down. Once she reaches the ground, she will quickly rebuild her mech."
3666 = "Try using USPECIAL and then airdodging 3 times."
3667 = "Awesome!"

3681 = "Shovel Knight can collect these gems to gain currency, which can be used to buy items and armor."

3687 = "One of the relics you can buy is the WAR HORN. It lets out a powerful blast of sound that sends enemies directly away from you. The outer edge of the attack is stronger than the center."
3688 = "Try purchasing the WAR HORN and using NSPECIAL to hit me 3 times."
3689 = "Great!"
3690 = "Another item you can purchase is the GHOST GLOVE. This lets you fire quick, short-ranged projectiles."

3692 = "Try hitting me with the GHOST GLOVE 3 times."
3693 = "Fantastic!"
3694 = "The third and final purchasable relic is the MOBILE GEAR. Once thrown, the MOBILE GEAR will deploy, becoming a moving platform that hits opponents and jumps when reaching the end of a platform."
3695 = "Hold a direction to change the angle you throw the MOBILE GEAR. Throwing it higher gives you more time to get on before it starts moving, while throwing it lower can make it avoid platforms."
3696 = "Try hitting me with a JAB while riding on the mobile gear."
3697 = "Marvelous!"
3698 = "You can also buy armor from the shop. The cheapest armor is the DYNAMO MAIL."

3703 = "The MAIL OF MOMENTUM makes Shovel Knight significantly heavier, but also makes it harder to stop when moving. This allows for sliding attacks and long wavedashes."
3704 = "The ORNATE PLATE makes you sparkle gold... and that's it. I'm not sure why you would ever buy it, actually."
3705 = "Another way to collect gems is to use DSPECIAL: the Fishing Rod."
3706 = "Cast your line into the bottom blastzone and press SPECIAL once '!!' appears over Shovel Knight's head. He will reel in a treasure rock that releases gems when hit."

3710 = "Holding down the SPECIAL button will charge the move, making it travel farther and hit harder."
3711 = "At full charge, Shovel Knight will use the INFINIDAGGER and travel an infinite distance. This move will bounce off of blastzones, so don't worry about flying off the side of the screen."
3712 = "While traveling on the ground, Shovel Knight can cancel the move by jumping, but only before it hits."
3713 = "The cancel is not instant, however, so you have to commit to the forward momentum. Holding backward when jump-cancelling will cause Shovel Knight to turn around when he jumps."
